// This file defines the Google API keys required for the application to function.
// In a production environment, these values would typically be injected by a build process
// or served from a secure backend. For this application, they are expected to be available
// as environment variables (e.g., process.env.API_KEY, process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID).
// Please ensure these environment variables are correctly configured in your deployment.

// The API_KEY and GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID are now accessed directly via process.env
// For example: process.env.API_KEY, process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

// Placeholder spreadsheet IDs for internal sheets. These should ideally also be environment variables
// or fetched from a secure configuration service in a production environment.
